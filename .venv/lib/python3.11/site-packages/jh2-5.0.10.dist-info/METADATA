==========================
jh2: HTTP/2 Protocol Stack
==========================

This repository is a fork of the well known hyper/h2 package. We want to provide a cleaner and faster HTTP/2
state machine while keeping a pure Python implementation. We decided to embed the leaf dependencies as we want
a neater dependency tree and along with that a easier maintenance burden. We believe it was a mistake to ship
three packages (h2, hpack, and hyperframe).

Analysis shown that h2 spend a lot of time doing hpack encode and decode operations, this is why we decided to offer
a complementary optimized build. The pure Python version will still be available.

This repository contains a pure-Python implementation of a HTTP/2 protocol
stack. It's written from the ground up to be embeddable in whatever program you
choose to use, ensuring that you can speak HTTP/2 regardless of your
programming paradigm.

You use it like this:

.. code-block:: python

    import jh2.connection
    import jh2.config

    config = jh2.config.H2Configuration()
    conn = jh2.connection.H2Connection(config=config)
    conn.send_headers(stream_id=stream_id, headers=headers)
    conn.send_data(stream_id, data)
    socket.sendall(conn.data_to_send())
    events = conn.receive_data(socket_data)

This repository does not provide a parsing layer, a network layer, or any rules
about concurrency. Instead, it's a purely in-memory solution, defined in terms
of data actions and HTTP/2 frames. This is one building block of a full Python
HTTP implementation.

To install it, just run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m pip install jh2
